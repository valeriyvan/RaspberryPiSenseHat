In order to acquire some experience in Swift development for Linux, I started tinkering with the Raspberri Pi Sense Hat shield. First half day of tinkering in attempt blinking with LED ended up in finding bug in Swift in `Strideable` implementation. Will contribute soon to Swift validation tests to show bug to community.

This repo can remain in an abandoned semi-working state for quite some time. May or may not sometime turn into Swift package with features similar to this [python library](https://pythonhosted.org/sense-hat/). We will see.

TODO:
* get/set individual pixel colors
* get/set all pixels in one shot
* show text with animation
* show arbitarary image on LED matrix
